December comes around again...

This is my repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021.
I'm going to be doing most problems in R, but I'm hoping to also throw in some Haskell, Julia and maybe a bit of APL too.


| Day | R                 | Haskell                 |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------------|
|   1 | [⭐⭐](./R/day_1.R) | [⭐⭐](./haskell/day1.hs) |
|   2 | [⭐⭐](./R/day_2.R) | [⭐](./haskell/day2.hs) |
